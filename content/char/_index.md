Male red fox. Generally
{{<charcolor "dark-purple">}}dark purple{{</charcolor>}} with
just a few markings.

* Typical red fox markings, except with shades of purple
* {{<charcolor "blue">}}Blue{{</charcolor>}} stripe down the spine to the tip of the tail
* {{<charcolor "light-purple">}}Light purple{{</charcolor>}} eyes
* {{<charcolor "blue">}}Blue{{</charcolor>}} pawpads

Wears a {{<charcolor "blueberry">}}blueberry{{</charcolor>}} collar with
{{<charcolor "gold">}}gold{{</charcolor>}} accents.

Perhaps around 5'10", but not fixed.

I quite like the recent trend of lighter shades of purple, the icon at
the top is my favorite colors so far. I also tend to love bright, vibrant
colors. I'm really not picky, and love seeing what artists envision :3

No specific colors are expected to be used, artists are encouraged to
use whatever fits best with their style and the theme of the work.

    Penis is canine in style including sheath, about 7" long, and
    {{<charcolor "blue">}}blue{{</charcolor>}}.

    Typically extremely submissive, although a dominant side does surface
    infrequently. Quite often seen locked in a chastity device.
